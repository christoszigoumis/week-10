I started off by trying the photogrammetry-intro.ipynb on Jupter. The first two blocks of code worked until I ran into an error at the third block of code. It said

"IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS FOR ADVICE ON HOW TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE!

Importing the numpy C-extensions failed. This error can happen for
many reasons, often due to issues with your setup or how NumPy was
installed.

I tried the static website builder, which to my surprise actually worked and I was able to get the website up and running, definitely a success, I didn't run into any errors with this.
