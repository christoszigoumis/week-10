"There is a myriad of small stories that rise up out of the debris of the dead residents in Building 3. I come now to the closely tethered but high-flying flights of
imagination that bring light and sound to the silent archaeological remains. I have
considered the story of “Dido,” the mature 40–45-year-old woman, whose death
probably triggered the remodeling of Building 3 in which the active space of the
building diminished by closing off access to the western “storage” room, in many
versions in many different formats (e.g., Tringham 2015a, b).8" Tringham, Ruth. 2020. Closely Observed Layers: Storytelling and the Heart in Kisha Supernant, Jane Eva Baxter, Natasha Lyons, Sonya Atalay (eds). Archaeologies of the Heart, Springer, Cham, 2020. 249.

It is interesting how archaeological excavations of burials are still able to tell strong stories of people from thousands of years ago. Sometimes they are even more emotionally moving than contemporary deaths, provided it isn't a relative or friend. Knowing that someone millennia ago died younger than they should have, even before the advent of modern medicine, strongly ties us to the distant past.

The article by Beale et al. was an interesting read for sure. I feel like the applications of multimedia technologies in archaeology can be powerful to disperse to the public many things about archaeology. Which is very significant to archaeologists and archaeological sites because they are typically in large part only funded by the publics continued interest in the sites and work done on the sites, for instance the Parthenon, or the Colosseum.

"The contemporary situation local to themountain and more broadly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic makes it impossible to conduct fieldwork on Kasios, and has encouraged us to respond to these situations creatively, leading to theexperimental approach to landscape phenomenology and atmosphere in Virtual Reality taken here" Collar, A. and S. Eve. 2021. Fire for Zeus: using Virtual Reality to explore meaning and experience at Mount Kasios. World Archaeology 52.3: https://doi.org/10.1080/00438243.2021.1920458 (alternative link).

I think its great that VR is being used in this instance where a certain geopolitical situation prohibts physical archaeological work from being done. There are so many cases of this in the world, especially in the Middle East, which occur sometimes sporadically. For example the tradegdy of Palmyra where ISIS blew up large portions of the Roman city, or when the Taliban destroyed the Buddhas of Bamiyan. I wonder if there have been efforts to reconstruct Palmyra virtually before its destruction by ISIS?
