"There is a myriad of small stories that rise up out of the debris of the dead residents in Building 3. I come now to the closely tethered but high-flying flights of
imagination that bring light and sound to the silent archaeological remains. I have
considered the story of “Dido,” the mature 40–45-year-old woman, whose death
probably triggered the remodeling of Building 3 in which the active space of the
building diminished by closing off access to the western “storage” room, in many
versions in many different formats (e.g., Tringham 2015a, b).8" Tringham, Ruth. 2020. Closely Observed Layers: Storytelling and the Heart in Kisha Supernant, Jane Eva Baxter, Natasha Lyons, Sonya Atalay (eds). Archaeologies of the Heart, Springer, Cham, 2020. 249.

It is interesting how archaeological excavations of burials are still able to tell strong stories of people from thousands of years ago. Sometimes they are even more emotionally moving than contemporary deaths, provided it isn't a relative or friend. Knowing that someone millennia ago died younger than they should have, even before the advent of modern medicine, strongly ties us to the distant past.
